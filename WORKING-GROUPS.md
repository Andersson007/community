# Creating an Ansible Working Group

## What are Working Groups

Working Groups are a way for Ansible community members to self-organize around particular topics of interest.

The basic components of a working group:
* Group name and charter (why the group exists);
* Registered [real-time chat](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/communication.html#real-time-chat) channel;
* Group of users (at least two!) who will be driving the agenda of the working group;
* Dedicated wiki space.

The basic responsibilities of a working group:
* Follow the [Ansible Community Code of Conduct](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/code_of_conduct.html).
* Be responsive on your real-time chat channel;
* Report semi-regularly on the cool stuff that your working group is working on;
* Keep your wiki space clean!

You can find the list of existing working groups in the [Ansible communication guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/communication.html#working-groups).

## Requesting a Working Group

Anyone can request to start a Working Group, for any reason. 

Paste the following text into a [community issue](https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/new) and replace the examples in brackets
with your own working group info:

```
WORKING GROUP NAME:    [ Example: unicorn   ]

WORKING GROUP PURPOSE:
[ Example: This working group is to review  ]
[ all Unicorn-related modules               ]
[                                           ]
(keep it short and sweet)

AT LEAST TWO INITIAL WORKING GROUP MEMBERS:
[ Matrix/Libera.Chat IRC: gregdek / GitHub: @gregdek           ]
[ Matrix/Libera.Chat IRC: rbergeron / GitHub: @robynbergeron   ]
[                                           ]
(provide the Matrix/Libera.Chat IRC nicks AND GitHub IDs of your working group members, one name per line please)

REAL-TIME CHAT CHANNEL: [ Example: Matrix: #unicorn:ansible.com | Libera.Chat IRC: #ansible-unicorn ]
(if they don't exist yet, mention that they need to be created)
(you can start with a Matrix channel, then we can add an IRC channel if needed and bridge them)
```

For more information about real-time chat options, see the [Ansible communication guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/communication.html#real-time-chat).
