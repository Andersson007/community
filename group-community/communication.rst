What problem are we trying to solving?
======================================

We recognise that although a lot of people know and love IRC it does have some short commings for some people, such as:

* Unless you are running a persistent connection (bouncer) you lose history
* Not everybody likes IRC

The Ansible Community Working Group is looking at making it easier for people to join the Ansible Discussions


What's the proposed solution?
=============================

We will experiment with using `Matrix.org <https://matrix.org>`_ to allow people to connect to our Freenode channels.

Matrix is an ecosystem for open and interoperable communication.

How can we use Matrix?
======================

1. Create a `Matrix.org account <https://matrix.org/beta/#/register>`_
2. Join `ansible on Matrix <https://matrix.to/#/#freenode_#ansible:matrix.org>`_, if you are just starting we suggest riot.im
  
   a. Sign into `#ansible on riot.im <https://riot.im/app/#/room/#freenode_#ansible:matrix.org>`_ using the credentials you created in step 1

3. Join any of the other channels listed below that you are interested in
4 We love feedback, let us know how it's going in `ansible-community <https://matrix.to/#/#freenode_#ansible-community:matrix.org>`_.
